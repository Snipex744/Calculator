# Calculator
Very VERY basic calculator that i want to keep working on. This is my first ever coding project so this is gonna go pretty slowly.

You have five options right now; add, subtract, multiply, divide, and square root. One you choose an option, you'll be locked into that mode until running again.

Stuff to add:
-Protection against special characters.
-Actual interface(Much later.)



Also try 0 and 0.
